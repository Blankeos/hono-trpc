<h1>
Hono tRPC Example Project
</h1>

Just a demo of Hono and tRPC in a monorepo. I wanted to try this out as an alternative
to Hono's own RPC feature and compare its features. If you like Hono RPC instead, you can check out my [Hono RPC Examples](https://github.com/Blankeos/hono-rpc-examples).

The frontend can be anything, I just chose Solid + [Vike][vike-url] (for SSR) for this example.

## Requirements

1. [Bun (latest)][bun-install-url]

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

```sh
bun install
```

2. Run the app

```sh
bun dev # Runs bun server:dev and bun client:dev
```

## Differences with Hono RPC that I noticed.

The current differences I see are:

- [x] Feature: Batch fetching with tRPC client.
  - When initializing the client, you can `httpBatchLink` to do batching.
  - You can use `httpLink` to not use batching.
- [x] Maturity: tRPC is (probably) more mature and battle-tested than Hono RPC.
- [x] Paradigm: In `trpc.ts`, you can export reusable base:
  - Routers
  - Procedures (e.g. protectedProcedure, publicProcedure) - The alternative would be to use **middlewares** for <u>controller-level</u> protection or use a **utility** for <u>endpoint-level</u> protection.
- [x] Paradigm: REST-facing is difficult unless you use `trpc-openapi`.
  - 1. because if your URL queries are always inside `?input` of the URL query (e.g. `:4000?input="Carl"`)
  - 2. If your query has multiple variables, you can't do (e.g. `?name="Carl"&age="23"`) - I have not tested this yet.
  - 3. Query Objects are always parsed as URL strings:
    - `const input = { name: "Carl" }` will be
    - `input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%221%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Carl%22%7D%7D`

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime. -->
